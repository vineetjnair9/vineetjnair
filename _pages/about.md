Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in Computational Science & Mechanical Engineering at MIT, working with Dr. Anuradha Annaswamy. I apply optimization algorithms, control and game theory, numerical methods, and machine learning to power grids, energy systems, electricity market design, and transportation networks. Broadly, I'm passionate about developing computational tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation, clean energy, sustainability & environmental justice. You can learn more about my educational and work experiences [here](https://vineetjnair9.github.io/cv/) and a list of publications [here](https://vineetjnair9.github.io/publications/). I am looking for either postdoctoral or full-time research positions in academia or industry after May 2025.
